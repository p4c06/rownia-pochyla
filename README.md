Code for my physics class project, slope with time masuring

It was aiming to prove the law of conservation of energy, which is shown in section 2 of [this file](/obliczenia.pdf). 

It works by meauring voltage on two photoresitors, one at start, second at the end. When the ball passes photoresistor it covers the sunlight and voltage drops. It can be seen on this chart ![chart](/przyk≈Çad.pdf).
